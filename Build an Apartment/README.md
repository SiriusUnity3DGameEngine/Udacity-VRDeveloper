### Time to conclude the project

I spent 6 days (20 hours)

### What i liked

Create a scene with materials, lights, animation/trigger and ambient sound was amazing!

### What was challenging

The first problem was the trigger, until i found that i would need to change c.enabled to true. 

I've spent a lot of time to make the Unity app work, the last Unit version have many bugs dealing with lights and one of them is realtime directional light. I had to restart the app and build many times to make all the lights work properly, but the directional light refused to work, so i did a night scene. When i've completed everything the apk was crashing and i've deleted Unity (tried early versions and reinstall the last), Java, Android Studio and nothing worked! Nobody could find the error with the logcat. 

I did all the project again, and had trouble with the skybox that i've did and the diffusion shade of the globe but i found out the fix after some search.
Exported the apk using the Unity Beta 5.5.0b10 and it worked! Submitted and the reviewer couldn't review it. Tried to downgrade the project with .meta options but didn't worked. Did all the project again in Unity 5.4.2.
