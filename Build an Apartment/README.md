##Development and experience

In this project i learned and put into practice the lessons about lightning (light baking and kinds of lights); animation (making the globe rotates through the animator); performance optimization in Unity with Mobile/Unlit shaders, Static lights/objects, Quality and Lightmap Settings (the project was intended to Cardboard, so it's important that it runs in constant and high FPS).  Also i learned how to use Google VR SDK for Unity and deploy my project properly.
For this project, i designed the starry night skybox in Adobe Photoshop and recorded the street sounds.
