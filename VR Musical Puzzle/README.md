# VR Musical Puzzle


In this Udacity VR developer project the purpose is design a puzzle inspired in the popular Simon says game, where orbs play a sequence that user needs to repeat. Along with the process of design, there are user tests and documentation of all the steps of the work.  

When i started the project my purpose was a simple Simon says look a like experience. I wanted to make the experience special so i did the skybox, a simple ground texture and all the sounds. When i was thinking about how the orb sound would be i realized that the puzzle could be a great tool to teach music notes.   Make this project was amazing. 

I've learned a lot about the creative process of design, mechanics, movement, documentation and user experience. Now i feel confident that i can make a great VR experience with competent UI/UX and publish it in a way that the reader/user will understand what is the game, how it works and how and why i did it.
