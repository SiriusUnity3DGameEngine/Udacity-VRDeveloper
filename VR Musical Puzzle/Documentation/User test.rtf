#User test \

\
###Subject 1: female, 26 years old, no experience in VR, some experience in games\
\
\
	\'95	How do you feel about your size?\
\
I think it\'92s ok, but i would feel better if i could see from a upper angle.\
\
	\'95	Could you describe your feelings?\
\
Yes\'85 I\'92m a little claustrophobic without an exit door and the mood is a little creepy.\
\
(I told her to rotate and look outside)- Wow! Outside is like another planet with a strange and beautiful sky. Can i go there?\
\
	\'95	What about the lights? \
\
They match well the creepy mood of this kind of prison, but i think i would be more comfortable with brighter lights.\
\
	\'95	There\'92s something else that you would like to point?\
\
These green balls with this light are stranger and i can\'92t understand what i have to do.\
\
\
###Subject 2: male, 22 years old, gamer, no experience in VR\
\
	\'95	How do you feel about your size?\
\
Hmm\'85 It\'92s not the same that the real world\'85 But i\'92m a tall guy, so i don\'92t know if i can trust in my perception.\
\
	\'95	Could you describe your feelings?\
\
It\'92s a very cool medieval place inside, it\'92s a dungeon? I like it a lot, would be great have a village out there. But the spacial surround is very cool and curious.\
\
	\'95	What about the lights? \
\
The torches are very weak and i don\'92t like the light coming from the roof. \
\
	\'95	There\'92s something else that you would like to point?\
\
Yes, the orbs are too big for this small room.\
\
\
##Conclusion\
\
I\'92ve changed the position of the camera, increased the torches intensity, removed the wall blocking the exit gate and \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
decreased the orbs size.\
