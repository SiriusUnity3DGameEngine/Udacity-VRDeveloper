## My experience
 Here i've learned how to work with a done project, navigate and customize some settings in Unity and deploy/build to mobile.

## How to run

To run the VR experiences you will need to follow these steps:

- Download the Google GVR SDK for Unity indicated on the README.md project 
- Open the downloaded project and click the GVR Unity installer and import all
- Build and export the app for your platform 

###If you see any Unity error follow these steps:

- Select the option **Import All** in Unity
- Restart the Project
