![alt tag](https://github.com/devreis/Udacity-VRDeveloper/blob/master/GalleryVrInnovation/Screenshots/1waypoint.png?raw=true)

Built this project as a result of a research on areas impacted by Virtual Reality. The intent of this experience is present the innovations provided by VR on architecture through an interactive way, informing and amusing the user.

## The process

In this project I created the building, windows, grids, lights, baseboard and rails using SketchUp. The PBR textures are the Unity ones with the exception of the wall texture, that I downloaded from a site. Movement mechanic was copied from an Udacity project with iTween and the videos playing inside the scene are working through AVPro plugin.

## My experience

Make this project was amazing, I had a lot of joy creating the materials and the building. Also, I learned more about architecture, that is one of my interests.
