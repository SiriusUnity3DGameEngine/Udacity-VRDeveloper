# Victor Reis

## Google VR SDK Version 1.0

### Time to conclude the project

I spent 10-12 days.

### What i liked

Be able to create a more complex experience and learn more about interactions, animation and how to call objects.

### What was challenging

The most challenging part was the interaction between the key and the door. Aside i had a hard time trying to fix the flickering and ugly shadows artifacts, but found in some forum posts that it's a Unity version bug. I've tried to bake the lightmap in pc mode and android mode, changed mobile/unlit to standard and experimented with the quality and light settings, nothing worked 100%.
