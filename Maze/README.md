# Maze

In this maze the player moves through waypoints to find the hidden key that opens the gate. Along the way coins can be collected.

## The process

In this project i designed the maze with the given itens and used C# scripting and Monobehaviour built-in methods to interact with itens and make them interact with each other: coins that disappears when clicked, sparkling particles and sound; a gate that play different sounds based on the key status; the gate moves upward when the user have the key; the fake wall that contains the key is destroyed with the click and reveal the key; if the final UI panel is clicked the player is teleported to the initial state.

## My experience

I learned a lot in this project, mainly programming. I spent a lot of time dealing with how to make the door interact with the key and sounds.
